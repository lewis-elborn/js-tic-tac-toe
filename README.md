## Why did I build this?

So, to cut a long story short; I came across this awesome video by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw), [linked here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-GkMjUZsmM&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified). I thought to myself I want to try that. So here we are!

I didn't however, just want to build the same project, I wanted to give it a little bit of my own flair. I've also been wanting to try my hand at Neumorphism and this just seemed like a great little project to get stuck in.

I hope you enjoy!
